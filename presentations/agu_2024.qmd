# What is SIMWE?

**SIMWE** (SIMulation of Water Erosion Model) is a spatially distributed processes-based overland flow model that simulates water flow using the Monte Carlo path sampling method.

## Computational Demands of Overland Flow Modeling

- Restrictive for research and policy development
- Emergency management applications require rapid response times
- Accuracy depends on particle density
- Spatial scale influences particle density required for accurate results

# Why is this a problem?
The accuracy of overland flow simulations using path sampling methods depends heavily on particle density.
However, varying particle density and spatial scale can be computationally demanding.

# How did we approach this problem?
We varied particle density and spatial scale to understand their impact on simulated water flow patterns.
We also repeated our analysis on several different terrain types to account for terrain slope and complexity.

# What did we find?
Our results show that there is a strong relationship between particle density, spatial scale, and computational demands.
We also identified optimal particle density ranges for different spatial scales and terrain types.

# What's next?
Our findings have implications for future users of the SIMWE model.
We hope that our work will help optimize tradeoffs between accuracy and computational demand.
